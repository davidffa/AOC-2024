# Input files

As the input files are copyrighted, I do not include them here, so if you want to test the solutions with your own inputs, create an account in https://adventofcode.com/ and place in this folder your input files with the format `day-nn.txt` where nn is the number of the day (eg. 01, 02, 10, 20, 24...)
